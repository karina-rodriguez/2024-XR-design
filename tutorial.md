##Connecting to Oculus Quest headset

For the coursework, if you would like to use the Oculus Quest, you will 
need to link to this through an App and enable developer mode:


For this, download [Meta Horizon](https://horizon.meta.com/) and register
an account.

For the pairing code, go to Apps -> Settings -> About.

You should enable the same profile in both the app, and the 
Oculus Quest headset. For this, go to Apps -> Settings -> Profile and add a 
new profile.

To enable developer mode, see:
