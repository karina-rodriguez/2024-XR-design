Development brings together teams with complementary expertise using:

- Agile iterative philosophy for software development
focusing on collaboration and user-centered development, and 
- DevOps methodology to deploy code using modern tools
and automated processes.

## Prototyping

A prototype is a low-fidelity version of the envisaged product. Prototyping focuses on exploring a MVP and how useful is the product is to the user.

Helps to illustrate an idea or better define the 'problem' (exploratory).


It can bring together stakeholders from the initial stages of development.

## Additional considerations
- Non functional requirements: Accessibility, inclusivity (or exclusivity)
- Larger picture: Business models, inc. funding and points of sale/purchase
