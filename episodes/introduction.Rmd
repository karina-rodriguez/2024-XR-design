:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How important is good design of XR systems?
- How can XR systems be designed to respond to ?

#- What software development methods best adapt to developing XR systems?
#- What XR user design considerations need to be accounted for
#different modalities of interaction and sensing in XR systems?
#- How is interactivity in an XR system implemented at a high-level in code?

## What is the meaning of design?


::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge: Are we designers?

In groups of 2, reflect on the software systems you have
worked on in the last couple of years, and discuss:

1. What the final product was?
2. Who were the intended consumers of this product?
3. How did you take into account their needs, if you did so?



::::::::::::::::

Product consumption is
"as an integral part of the same social system which explains the 
urge to work, which in its turn is a component of the social need
to enter into relations with others and to have available communication materials which allow relations with others to take place".

## Interactive Experiences

> Knowledge is acquired in a continuous process of accommodating prior expectations and beliefs to new realities learned through interactive experiences (Jensen, 1999)

Jensen, N. (1999). Children, teenagers and adults in museums: a developmental perspective. In Hooper-Greenhill, E. (Ed.), The Educational Role of the Museum, 2nd ed., Routledge.


Interactive experiences are the basis of knowledge (constructivist theory of knowing).

Experiences cannot just be provided or delivered.

In **User Design (UX)**, interactive experiences connect users with an ‘environment’ in non-passive ways.

An **experience curator** designs an experiential framework, but the way the experience is perceived belongs to the user.
