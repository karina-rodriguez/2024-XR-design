Established in UX design, user-centered method support 
developing systems with users requirements at heart.

![User centered design process &copy; Whale Design - stock.adobe.com](fig/AdobeStock_424127018.jpeg){alt="centred design"}

Supports digital experience design, engagement and enables deep users insight.

Promotes accessibility, inclusivity and democratisation.

Facilitates vision development, strategic thinking of systems which will be built.

### Forms of user segmentation

- Demographic
- Psychographic
- Behavioural
- Geographic

Example segmentation tools: [Office of National Statistics Profiles - Census 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/customprofiles/draw/)

**Who**: who is the user?

**What**: what will the users do? what is their task/s?

**When**: when will the users perform the task (at home, in the exhibition?)

**Where**: where will the users live the experience (physical environment, conditions, other users and more)?

**Why**: why do users perform the tasks (purpose, goal)?

**How**: how will they perform the tasks?


## Who is the user?
Some key points to examine when thinking of the user:

- Personal information
- Professional information
- Goals
- Values
- Communication and media
- Frustrations

## Challenge in groups of 2 or 3: User profiling

Select a geographical area in Brighton, or another city, to identify users
for your intended
XR system. 

Using the
profile tool from [National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/customprofiles/draw/),
explore the type of users they are.

Reflect on characteristics, such as which jobs
they have, are they families or young people,
how much disposable income have and what 
type of activities they like doing.

Try to reflect on the type of equipment they might have access to
when it comes to XR applications, and other
types of decisions which might affect the type of
system you want to develop.

## XR experience design

Interconnected with User Experience (UX).

It should captures the user's journey when interacting 
with the system, service or product.

Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), 
the Minimal Marketable Product (MMP),
and ideas to be 
prototyped and tested. 

In XR systems it is particularly important to test
the feasibility of the system delivering
the experience as envisaged.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Understanding who the user is and their circumstances is the first step
for formulating an XR application
- Some techniques like profiling and the 5 W's are useful to 
brainstorm.
